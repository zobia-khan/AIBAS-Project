## Short Characterization of OLS model

This project also utilizes an **Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression model** to predict customer churn in a banking environment.  
OLS is a statistical method used to estimate the relationship between independent variables (customer features) and the dependent variable (churn/exited). 

### **Prediction:**
The model predicts the probability of a customer **leaving the bank (churn = 1) or staying (churn = 0)** based on historical data.  
It minimizes the sum of squared differences between actual and predicted churn values.

### **Evaluation Metrics:**
The OLS model is evaluated using:
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
- **R-squared score**
